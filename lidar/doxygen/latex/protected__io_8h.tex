Write to am 8-\/bit I/O register protected by CCP or a protection bit. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em addr} & Address of the I/O register \\
\hline
{\em magic} & CCP magic value or Mask for protection bit \\
\hline
{\em value} & Value to be written\\

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Using IAR Embedded workbench, the choice of memory model has an impact on calling convention. The memory model is not visible to the preprocessor, so it must be defined in the Assembler preprocessor directives.
